 In the image provided, there appears to be a bright light or object moving across the night sky. It is not typical of a clear night sky, which would usually only contain stars, the Milky Way, and perhaps a few meteors or shooting stars. The object in question is quite large and has a distinct shape, almost like a boomerang or teardrop, with a pointed front end and a wider body, and it's moving from left to right in the sky.
