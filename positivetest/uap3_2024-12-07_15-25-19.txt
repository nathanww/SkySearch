 In the image provided, there appears to be a series of three objects in the sky, which look like they could be flying vehicles or perhaps lanterns given their similarity. These objects are arranged roughly in a line and have evenly spaced intervals between them. The first two appear to be moving along an arc, as if they are in flight or drifting through the air. The third object is further away and slightly above the first two, with its trajectory seemingly more vertical than horizontal. There are no other unusual phenomena visible in this image; it simply shows these three objects against a night sky background.
