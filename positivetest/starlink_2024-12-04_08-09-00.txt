 In the image provided, there are several objects visible in the night sky that appear to be unusual or out of place. These objects do not have typical features associated with aircraft; rather, they seem to defy conventional explanations for their presence in the sky.

Starting from the left, there is a bright object that looks like a planetarium star map, but it moves in a way that defies the rotation of stars. It does not follow a predictable path and instead changes direction rapidly. This could be due to digital manipulation or an error in the image processing, as it moves contrary to the known patterns of celestial bodies.

Further right, there is another bright object with a similar behavior. It appears to move in a way that does not correspond with any known celestial body's movement, making it seem out of place and unusual.

There are no other objects in the sky that are noteworthy or out of place, based on this description. The rest of the image shows typical night sky features like the Milky Way galaxy, constellations, and stars with natural movement patterns.
