 In the image provided, it appears that there are several bright objects in the sky, including the Moon, which is visible near the top center of the frame, slightly right-of-center. Additionally, there seems to be a distinct constellation or cluster of stars that is oriented horizontally and has a vertical line extending upward from its center. This formation is unusual as it does not correspond to any known constellation or star pattern commonly recognized in astronomy. The alignment and shape of these objects resemble a geometric figure rather than a natural astronomical phenomenon.
