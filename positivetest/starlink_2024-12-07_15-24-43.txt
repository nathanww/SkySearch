 In the image, we see a night scene with what appears to be stars and constellations visible against the deep blue sky. There's also a faint glow near the horizon, which could be interpreted as a light source or haze on the horizon line. The main unusual phenomenon is a sequence of lights that seem to change positions in an orderly fashion over a 30-second period.

The lights start at the top right corner and appear to move towards the bottom left corner in a straight line, suggesting they might be from a single source or object, possibly an airplane. The regularity of their placement and movement suggests that these are likely stars or aircraft, rather than random lights captured within 30 seconds of a single photo. There is no other unusual activity or objects observed in the sky.
