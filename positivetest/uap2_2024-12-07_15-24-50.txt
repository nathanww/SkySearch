 In both images, there are objects that appear to be unusual for the context of a nighttime scene with no aircraft or activity visible in the first image. The second image shows two bright, spherical-shaped objects, one on the left and one on the right, which seem to have appeared suddenly between the two photos. These could potentially be drones, lights from other vehicles, or some kind of atmospheric phenomenon, but without additional context or information, it's difficult to provide a definitive explanation for their presence. They are not visible in the first image and are absent in the third image, suggesting they may have been temporary or transient occurrences, possibly related to an event that took place during the brief period between the two photographs.
