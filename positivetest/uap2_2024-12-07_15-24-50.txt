 In the image, there appears to be a bright light that has been captured at two different times, indicating it was visible during both snapshots. The lights are located in the upper part of the sky and do not seem to be moving in a typical way for conventional aircraft or natural phenomena like stars or planets.

At the time captured in the first photo, there is only one bright light, which is smaller and less distinct than the object's appearance in the second image. The object in the second photo has significantly increased in size and appears to be moving towards the right side of the frame. The change in size and position suggests that the light may have been some form of aircraft or a vehicle with its lights on, as it is not consistent with the natural phenomena like stars or planets.
