 In the image, there is a noticeable alignment of celestial objects that creates an optical illusion known as "sailing stars." This effect occurs when the trailing stars appear stationary relative to the horizon, despite their actual movement across the sky. The unusual aspect here is that the apparent motion of these stars has been stopped in this particular moment, giving the impression that they are not moving at all. In reality, the stars are moving at a constant rate across the sky due to the Earth's rotation, but from this perspective, it seems as if the stars have halted their course and are stationary in relation to the ground.
