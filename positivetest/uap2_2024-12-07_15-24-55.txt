 In the image provided, there appear to be three objects in the sky that could be considered unusual based on their characteristics. These objects seem to have a similar shape and size, and they exhibit a trail behind them, suggesting that they are moving at a high speed. They also emit lights or flames at their ends, which is not typical for aircraft, especially when viewed from ground level.

The first object is located towards the center of the image, while the second and third objects are slightly to its right and further into the distance, with the third being the most distant. The positioning suggests that these objects may have been seen at different times or distances, which could indicate their movement across the sky in a short period of time.

Without additional context or knowledge about aviation, it is difficult to definitively identify these objects as aircraft or drones. However, given their characteristics and the sequence in which they are captured, one possible interpretation is that these could be meteorites entering the Earth's atmosphere from a specific point in the sky.
