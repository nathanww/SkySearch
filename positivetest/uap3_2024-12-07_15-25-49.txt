 In the image, there appears to be a bright light or object streaking across the sky from left to right, positioned centrally. The timing difference between the two photos does not show any significant changes in the position of this light. It is traveling at a constant velocity and direction, leaving behind no discernible trail or wake. This bright light is unusual because it lacks any recognizable shape or form typical of an aircraft or other known flying object. Its trajectory appears to be linear and uninterrupted, which could suggest it's moving faster than what one would expect for a conventional airplane or satellite.
