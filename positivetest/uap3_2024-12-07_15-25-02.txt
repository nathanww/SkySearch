 In the image, there appears to be a bright object that stands out against the dark night sky. It is difficult to determine if it's an unusual aircraft or phenomenon without additional context, such as the size of the object or any indications of movement. However, given that the second photo is 30 seconds after the first and there are no other objects in the sky, this single bright object seems to be stationary or moving very slowly if at all. The presence of the object could be unusual depending on its nature; it might be an aircraft, a drone, a light source such as a planet, satellite, or balloon, or something else entirely.
