 In both images, there appears to be a vertical elongated object streaking across the night sky from left to right at a near-horizontal angle. This object has a visible trail behind it, which suggests that it is moving rapidly through the atmosphere. The image quality is low, and the object's exact shape or size is difficult to discern, but its elongated form and the speed implied by the contrail make it an unusual sight.

The second photo, taken 30 seconds later, shows a similar vertical trajectory of the same object, further reinforcing the impression that it is moving swiftly through the sky. The context provided does not allow for any additional details about the location or background of these images to provide more information about the environment or conditions in which the photos were taken.
