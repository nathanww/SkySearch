 In the image, there appears to be an anomaly in the night sky that resembles a large circular or disc-shaped object with lights around its perimeter. This is not a typical sight one would expect to see in the night sky as it does not align with any common natural or man-made phenomena like planets, stars, clouds, or aircraft. The second image shows the same object but without the lights at the edges, indicating that the object's appearance has changed within 30 seconds, which is a very unusual characteristic for an object in the sky. This object does not correspond to any known celestial body or natural phenomenon and thus could be perceived as unusual. The surrounding environment includes buildings and hills, but nothing else in the sky can be confidently described as unusual based on this image alone.
