 In the image provided, there appears to be a bright light in the sky at the lower right corner, which looks like a celestial body or an aircraft that is atypical altitude for aviation. The light's trajectory suggests it could be descending from its current position. There are no other unusual phenomena visible in the sky, and there is nothing out of place in terms of the typical appearance of an airport and its surroundings during nighttime conditions. The image does not provide enough information to make any further critical statements about the sky or the unusual phenomena it might contain.
