 In the image provided, it appears there are several unusual aircraft or phenomena present in the sky:

1. Multiple instances of a large, dark shadow that seems to be casting over the landscape below. This could indicate either an object moving across the sky or a lighting anomaly creating the appearance of a shadow. It's not clear whether these shadows are natural, like clouds, or artificial, such as drones or searchlights.

2. There are what appear to be smaller, brighter lights scattered across the sky, which could be drones or other small aircraft not easily identifiable from this distance and angle.

3. The weather conditions at the bottom of the screen show that it is a cloudy night with rain in the forecast, but no visible signs of these conditions are seen in the sky above. This might indicate inconsistent weather patterns across different layers of the atmosphere or could be an error in the weather report display.
