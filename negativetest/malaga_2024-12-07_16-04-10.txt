 In the image, I see a variety of objects that could be considered unusual for a nighttime sky. There appears to be a large, stationary light source or some kind of brightly glowing object near the horizon, which is not common in skies and may suggest an illuminated airport, a city's lights, or possibly a specific event related to air traffic control or an aircraft issue. Additionally, there are several smaller, bright light sources scattered across the sky that could be interpreted as unusual aircraft due to their size and brightness relative to stars or other common nighttime celestial objects. However, without additional context or information about aviation activity in the area at the time of the image, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether these are unusual aircraft or some other type of light sources.
